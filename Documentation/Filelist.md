* **Target Version:** TYPO3 v14.0  
* **Forge Issue:** [#106471](https://forge.typo3.org/issues/106471)

## Rationale

- "Filelist" is not a familiar term for most users, especially non-German speakers. It carries a "Denglish" tone.
- The module is specifically about managing **media and downloadable content**, not general files.
- ‚ÄúMedia‚Äù is a widely accepted and intuitive term across other CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Drupal).
- Improves **usability** and **discoverability** for new users.
