# TYPO3 Terminology Updates

This document serves as a living reference for terminology changes in TYPO3. It aims to improve clarity, consistency, 
and inclusiveness across the system and documentation. Inspired by Agility CMS's approach to terminology modernization.

## âœ¨ Goals

- Align terminology with modern standards and community expectations
- Clarify naming to make TYPO3 more intuitive for newcomers and developers
- Ensure changes are well-documented and communicated across all platforms (labels, docs, UI, marketing)

## âœ… Terminology Evaluation Criteria

Each term should aim to meet the following criteria:

- **Unique** â€” Not used elsewhere in the UI or easily confused with another term.
- **Clear** â€” Meaning is immediately understandable and unambiguous.
- **Self-evident** â€” Reflects its function or purpose clearly.
- **Familiar** â€” Commonly used in similar contexts outside TYPO3.
- **Plain** â€” Simple language, avoids jargon or portmanteau.
- **English** â€” Proper American English spelling and grammar, not a translated term or foreignism.

> This is not a full UX checklist, but a guide for choosing the right label in isolation.
